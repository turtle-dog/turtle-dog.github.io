My favorite character in Animal Crossing is Kapp'n. I liked him before New Leaf, but he earned his position as favorite while giving my character boat rides to the island. The songs he sings, accompanied by a little ukulele, range from romantic, nonsensical, to sometimes disgustingly sentimental. I simply had to fall in love with him. Each boat ride, the lyrics and tune of the song varies - there are only two tunes that he chooses from, but there are many lyrics he could possibly sing. He first sings a few verses, then stops to make some comment to the player. Then he finally finishes off the song with a (possibly unrelated) last verse.
