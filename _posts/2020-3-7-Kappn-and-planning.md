I have one animal crossing plushie, but it's a really good one - Kapp'n ðŸ’š. I liked him before New Leaf, but he earned his position as favorite character while giving my player boat rides to the island. The songs he sings, accompanied by a ukulele, range from romantic, nonsensical, to sometimes disgustingly sentimental. I simply *had* to fall in love with him. I've compiled some of Kapp'n's song lyrics [on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/kappnsongs) if you're interested in browsing through some of them.
