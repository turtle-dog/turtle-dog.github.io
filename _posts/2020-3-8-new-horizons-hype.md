title: Waiting for New Horizons...
---

New Horizons drops in...12 days nowâ€½ I thought I'd compile some of the things I'm most excited about, and some of the things that I'm still holding out hope for. I already have my town name figured out: Pyxis! Pyxis is a constellation based on a mariner's compass, which I thought would be appropriate, given the deserted island theme. 

## New Horizons: What I'm most excited about
I was so impressed with the weather effects in the most recent direct. I'm so excited to experience my first storm on Pyxis. I've gifed some of my favorite wind-related moments - I was sort of freaking out about the wind...

The movement of the leaves of the trees, the flowers, and the weeds as the wind blows through them is just gorgeous. I almost find myself expecting that character's hat to blow off of his head - that would be a cute, albeit annoying feature.

I'm also so excited to be able to make a town with better pavement options, craftable outdoor items, etc. I really enjoyed the completed town in Happy Home Designer, shown below. It made me feel like I was able to (sort of) customize a City Folk-esque city, and New Horizons will give the opportunity to do that with even more potential for customization and creativity.

For comparison, here's an example of the enhanced outdoor customization from the most recent direct:

I don't think that Happy Home Designer-esque building customization will make an appearance in New Horizons, but I really wish they would. I loved customizing the look of cafes, restaurants, and shopping centers (inside and outside!) and watching villagers interact with my designs. It would be a dream come true if we could do this in New Horizons - having the option to construct a building, decorate it with some sort of budget and minimum requirements, and have my villagers interact with it once it was completed. I CRAVE THIS!

One other thing that I would love to see make a comeback is morning aerobics from Animal Crossing Gamecube. It was such a fun event and would give me a good excuse to get up in the morning, which I am absolutely terrible at doing consistently. Plus, there's something so refreshing about listening to radio calisthenics. I might start doing them myself...

I would also really like to see villagers have more fleshed-out personalities. It would be really cool if, for example, Moe, had unique dialogue options that you could unlock in some sort of obscure way, similar to the way your character has to befriend Sable in previous games. I realize that this is probably not feasible with the number of characters in Animal Crossing, but I can dream, can't I? If not more *unique* dialogue options, more dialogue options in general would be great. In previous games, I played so often that it started to become a chore to talk to villagers because they started repeating dialogue over and over again - sometimes different villagers would say the same thing. It is very immersion-breaking. Ideally, villagers would have so much dialogue to choose from that they would seldom, if ever, repeat something another villager said. Again, a girl can dream.

Let's end the post with some screenshots of the museum, which, as everyone's been pointing out, is absolutely *breathtaking*.

Anyway, as you can probably tell by clicking ctrl+f and typing "excited", I am so excited! ðŸ˜Š I'll see everyone on the other side of March 20th! ðŸ‘‹
