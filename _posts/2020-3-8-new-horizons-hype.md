title: Waiting for New Horizons...
---

New Horizons drops in...12 days nowâ€½ I thought I'd compile some of the things I'm most excited about, and some of the things that I'm still holding out hope for. I already have my town name figured out: Pyxis! Pyxis is a constellation based on a mariner's compass, which I thought would be appropriate, given the deserted island theme. 

## New Horizons: What I'm most excited about
I was so impressed with the weather effects in the most recent direct. I'm so excited to experience my first storm on Pyxis. I've gifed some of my favorite wind-related moments - I was sort of freaking out about the wind...

The movement of the leaves of the trees, the flowers, and the weeds as the wind blows through them is just gorgeous. I almost find myself expecting that character's hat to blow off of his head - that would be a cute, albeit annoying feature.

I'm also so excited to be able to make a town with better pavement options, craftable outdoor items, etc. I really enjoyed the completed town in Happy Home Designer, shown below. It made me feel like I was able to (sort of) customize a City Folk-esque city, and New Horizons will give the opportunity to do that with even more potential for customization and creativity.

For comparison, here's an example of the enhanced outdoor customization from the most recent direct:

One thing that I would love to see make a comeback is morning aerobics from original Animal Crossing. It was such a fun event and would give me a good excuse to get up in the morning, which I am absolutely terrible at doing consistently. Plus, there's something so refreshing about listening to radio calisthenics. I might start doing them myself...

Let's end the post with some screenshots of the museum, which, as everyone's been pointing out, is absolutely *breathtaking*.

Anyway, as you can probably tell by clicking ctrl+f and typing "excited", I am so excited! ðŸ˜Š I'll see everyone on the other side of March 20th! ðŸ‘‹
