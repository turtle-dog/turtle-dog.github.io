Is there no way to speak openly with you? Must we keep using metaphors? Must we keep evading each others' gaze? Do I know your name? Do you know mine?

Is there any way to access you consistently, or is it by a stroke of luck that I could talk to you before?

Who are you?

Are you in there?

Am I too late to save you?

Have I been hurting you very badly?

How often can you come up for air?

Is it scary in there?

Is it possible that we start working together?

Do you feel judged by me? Am I bothering you? I'm bothering me, even up here, above the surface.

Is it safer in there? Is that why you stay in there? All the layers of bitterness I've built, acting as insulation? Are you very sensitive, or very robust?
