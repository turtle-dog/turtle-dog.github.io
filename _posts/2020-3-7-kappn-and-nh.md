I have one animal crossing plushie, but it's a really good one - Kapp'n ðŸ’š. I liked him before New Leaf came out, but he earned his position as favorite character while giving my player boat rides to the island. The songs he sings, accompanied by a ukulele, range from romantic, nonsensical, to sometimes disgustingly sentimental. I, of course, am the kind of sucker that loves things like sappy lyrics and ukuleles, so I simply *had* to fall in love with him. I've compiled some of Kapp'n's song lyrics [on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/kappnsongs) if you're interested in browsing through some of them - keep in mind it's a work in progress. 

I am hoping Kapp'n will have some sort of role in the upcoming New Horizons, but I haven't seen much indication of what he could do. The player arrives to their island by plane, rather than by boat, and a new character has been introduced to fly the plane. So his previous roles as bus/boat/taxi driver may not be reprised. But I have faith that Nintendo will find a role for him! ðŸ¤ž

I am so excited for New Horizons. When the first direct finally dropped in June 2019 - I was visiting Japan at the time and had to set a timer for 2am to watch - I decided to keep a journal for my New Horizons island, logging ideas for names, layouts, themes, etc. I have since decided on the name "Pyxis" for my island, and with each new direct, I have more an more ideas for how I'm going to lay out my island.
