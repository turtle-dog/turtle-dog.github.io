Hi! I'm Elizabeth! I am a graduate student who loves art, language, movies, animation, music, and, most importantly... Animal Crossing! Inspired by many, many New Leaf blogs that I scoured for QR Codes and town-planning inspiration, I made a blog to keep track of my Animal Crossing: New Horizons experiences.

## My cat

I may occasionally take pictures of Animal Crossing merchandise I have. You may notice that these pictures may also include a cat. His name is Momo! I never really *intend* to have him in my pictures, but when I am arranging objects around on a table, he becomes very curious and ends up in the frame.

## Animal Crossing blogs that inspired me

Unfortunately, it appears as if some of these blogs are out of commission. But I'm holding out hope that some will be revived when New Horizons comes out!
