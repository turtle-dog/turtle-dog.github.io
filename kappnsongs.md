One of my favorite parts of New Leaf is Kapp'n's songs. They're so cute and I love the ukulele! There are two tunes he follows to varying lyrics, each tune having the same formula:


Part 1: Verses

Part 2: Pause for a comment from Kapp'n

Part 3: Bridge/ending


Each part of Kapp'n's "performance" is randomized, so sometimes the full song can be a bit nonsensical. I've compiled some of the lyrics that I encountered in New Leaf here.

### Part 1

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th> Licenses </th>
    <th> Love me just for me </th>
    <th> Oh, cucumber </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> I can't keep track<br>
Of all me licenses, man<br>
It seems the government can<br>
Charge me all day long!<br><br>

First there's me ship, then me car<br>
Then me business license too<br>
It's not fair! I don't care!<br>
And I won't pay<br>
If they tax this song! </td>
    <td>When I was young<br>
I wanted all the girls<br>
To love me just for me<br>
And not me good looks<br><br>

I've a nice face, it be true,<br>
chiseled abs and fancy hair.<br>
But I'm smart! I gots heart!<br>
I gots feelings<br>
I gots lots to share!</td>
    <td>Oh, cucumber<br>
You're not a pewcumber<br>
I love you so-o much<br>
You are me best friend<br><br>

Though you're a bit tho-orny,<br>
We can still get a-along<br>
Let's not fight! Take a bite!<br>
So-o tasty,<br>
Love you to the end!</td>

    <th> Wife ate all o' me chips </th>
    <th> Kissing me reflection </th>
    <th> Cucumber song </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Me wife says she<br>
Don't like me goin' to sea.<br>
She says that she misses me,<br>
But I ain't so sure!<br><br>

When I comes home from me trips<br>
She's eaten all o' me chips.<br>
All me cakes and snack packs!<br>
Guess me junk food is really just fer her?</td>
    <td>Sometimes I kiss me<br>
Own reflection in me window,<br>
And sometimes me<br>
Neighbors walk by!<br><br>

I'm just practicin' kissin'<br>
It's all fer me sweetie pie.<br>
But those stares! Oh those glares!<br>
Neighbors must think I'm such a weird guy!</td>
    <td>Ye can't go wrong<br>
With my Cucumber song<br>
Cucumber, Cucumber<br>
So green and long<br><br>

They're so good cooked or raw<br>
Or with some coleslaw<br>
Go get me two or three<br>
That I can gnaw</td>
